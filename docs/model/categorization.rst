Model categorization
--------------------
The model in brief can be characterized as a **bottom-up electricity investment and dispatch optimization model**.
In the following, a model characterization based on Hall and Buckley (2016) is introduced:

Model purpose and structure

    "Purpose of the model", "| General: scenario analyses (forecasting)
    | Specific: investments and power supply"
    "Structure of the model", "| Demand: exogenously (except for demand response)
    | Supply: RES exogenously; All other power sources endogenously optimized dispatch
    | Supply, storage & demand response investments optimized only for Germany"
    "Geographical coverage", "| National: Federal Republic of Germany + imports / exports from
    | / to adjacent electric neighbors"
    "Sectoral coverage", "| Power market (effectively day-ahead) from a macroeconomic point of view
    | (no bidding simulation)"
    "Time horizon", "Long-term (>= 20 years)"
    "Time step", "Hourly (4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours possible)"

    "Renewable Techology inclusion", "Hydro (run of river), Solar, Wind, Biomass"
    "Storage Technology Inclusion ", "| Pumped-hydro energy storage (dispatch & investment), Reservoir energy storage (dispatch),
    | Battery energy storage (investment)"
    "Demand Characteristic Inclusion", "| Aggregated demand for Industry, Residential Sector,
    | Commercial Sector and Transportation;
    | Demand response technologies in industry, residential and commercial sector"
    "Cost Inclusion", "Fuel prices, Operations and Maintenance Costs, CO2-costs"
